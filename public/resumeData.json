    "bio": "Hi there! I am Omar! I've been coding for over 3 years. During that period of time I have helped both big companies and family-owned small businesses. As you will see in this webpage and hopefully, if we meet, I have firstly developed my skills as engineer, then as a business man, since I realized that in order to create real value I needed to understand both business and coding. Even though my experience is highly varied, the common factor has been helping companies reach their goals.",
